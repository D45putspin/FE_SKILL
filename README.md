# frontend-design (Codex / OpenClaw Skill)

Studio-grade frontend generation skill that forces:
- a clear aesthetic thesis
- a signature differentiator
- real design systems (tokens, type, spacing, motion)
- accessibility + performance discipline
- anti-slop constraints

## How to use
Point your agent/tooling at `frontend-design/skill.md`.

Recommended workflow:
1. Create a design intent brief (internal).
2. Implement tokens first.
3. Build layout + typography.
4. Add surface model (grain / borders / lighting).
5. Choreograph motion (entrance + interactions).
6. Run acceptance checklist.
