# frontend-design (FE_SKILL)

Elite frontend design skill for OpenClaw/Codex.

## What it is
A design operating system for generating production-grade, memorable interfaces with explicit identity and quality gates.

## Fast Start
1. Read `GETTING-STARTED.md`
2. Fill `templates/design-intent-brief.md`
3. Build with `skill.md`
4. Validate with:
   - `templates/quality-scorecard.md` (must score >= 85)
   - `templates/review-report.md`
   - `templates/acceptance-checklist.md`

## Repo Structure
- `skill.md` — master instruction file
- `patterns/` — practical design playbooks
- `anti-patterns/` — explicit failure modes
- `snippets/` — reusable CSS/JS assets
- `templates/` — process + QA templates
- `examples/` — spec-guided reference tracks

## Release Standard
This repo is considered release-ready only when outputs include objective evidence (a11y/perf/state coverage), not style claims alone.
