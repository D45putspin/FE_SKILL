# Slop Triggers (Avoid)

- Generic SaaS hero with no product-specific identity
- Random gradients with no visual hierarchy
- CTA buttons that all look equally important
- Over-animated UI that distracts from tasks
- Fancy cards but no meaningful state handling
- Placeholder copy left in production

## Recovery
When in doubt, simplify to:
- clear hierarchy
- one primary action per section
- consistent spacing and typography
