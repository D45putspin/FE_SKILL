# Layout Clichés to Avoid

- 12 identical cards with no visual rhythm
- Giant hero + zero functional context below fold
- Sidebar + content with no clear priority map
- Excessive nested panels for simple workflows

## Better Patterns
- Use varied hierarchy (hero, summary, detail)
- Show real product actions early
- Keep primary workflow visible without scrolling too far
- Collapse advanced controls behind clear affordances
