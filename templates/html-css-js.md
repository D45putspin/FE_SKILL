# Template: HTML/CSS/JS Output Contract

When generating plain HTML/CSS/JS:
1. Start with a short design intent summary.
2. Provide complete, runnable `index.html`.
3. Include token variables in `:root`.
4. Implement at least 3 reusable UI primitives (button/card/input).
5. Include states (hover/focus/active/disabled).
6. Add reduced-motion safeguards.
7. End with a quick accessibility + performance note.

Prefer progressive enhancement and semantic HTML.
