# Template: React + Tailwind + shadcn Output Contract

When generating React/Tailwind UI:
1. State design intent and signature differentiator first.
2. Define token strategy (Tailwind theme + CSS vars where needed).
3. Provide component breakdown:
   - layout shell
   - section components
   - reusable primitives
4. Use shadcn components only when customized (not defaults).
5. Include interaction and focus states explicitly.
6. Include loading/empty/error states.
7. Mention performance and accessibility considerations.

Output should be production-oriented, not demo-only.
