# Performance

## Frontend Targets
- Fast first meaningful paint
- Smooth interactions (no jank)
- Predictable memory usage on long sessions

## Tactics
- Lazy-load heavy routes/components
- Optimize and compress images
- Avoid large animation repaint areas
- Memoize expensive computed UI slices
- Keep bundle size intentional

## Media-heavy Apps
- Use responsive image sizes
- Progressive loading for feeds
- Skeletons over spinner-only waiting

## Rule
A beautiful UI that feels slow is a failed design.
