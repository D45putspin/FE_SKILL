# Typography Recipes

## Pairing A: Display + Neutral Sans
- Display: for headings/hero labels
- Sans: body copy, controls, metadata

Great for premium consumer apps.

## Pairing B: Single Family System
- One family, multiple optical sizes/weights
- Very consistent and easy to scale

Great for enterprise and dashboards.

## Scale
- H1: 40-56
- H2: 28-40
- H3: 20-28
- Body L: 18
- Body: 16
- Caption: 12-14

## Rules
- Use max 2 families.
- Keep line-height readable (1.4-1.6 body).
- Tighten heading tracking slightly.
- Ensure mobile line breaks are intentional.
