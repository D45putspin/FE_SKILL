# Storytelling in UI

## Narrative Layers
1. First impression (hero/context)
2. Proof (examples/results/social evidence)
3. Action (clear primary CTA)

## For Product Flows
- Start with user outcome, not system complexity
- Use microcopy to reduce ambiguity
- Keep each step goal-oriented

## Visual Narrative
- Use one signature motif across key screens
- Reinforce state changes with subtle motion
- Keep information density progressive

## Rule
Every screen should answer: “What do I do next and why?”
