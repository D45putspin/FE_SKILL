# Interaction States

Every interactive element must define:
- default
- hover
- active/pressed
- focus-visible
- disabled
- loading (when applicable)

## Buttons
- Hover: small contrast/lift change
- Active: slight scale down
- Disabled: reduced opacity + no pointer

## Inputs
- Focus ring must be visible and accessible
- Error state needs text + icon/indicator
- Placeholder should never look like real value

## Lists/Cards
- Active selection has clear visual marker
- Keyboard navigation parity with pointer interactions

## Rule
If a state is not designed, it is broken by default.
