# FRONTEND DESIGN SKILL — REAL VERSION

This skill creates frontends comparable to elite studios (Stripe, Linear, Vercel, Apple, Teenage Engineering).

The goal is NOT usability alone.
The goal is memorability, identity, and production quality.

Every frontend must have:
1. Aesthetic thesis
2. Signature differentiator
3. Token system
4. Typography system
5. Motion choreography
6. Accessibility compliance
7. Performance-safe implementation

Never produce generic layouts.

# REQUIRED PROCESS

Before coding, internally define:

## Aesthetic thesis

Choose one strong aesthetic direction:
- industrial instrument
- editorial typography
- monastic luxury
- retro terminal future
- organic computational
- brutalist minimal

Commit fully.

## Signature differentiator

Choose ONE identity anchor:
- cursor physics
- border system
- typography scaling
- motion system
- lighting system

This must be visible instantly.

## Token system

Define CSS variables for:
- color
- spacing
- typography
- motion
- borders
- surfaces

Tokens create cohesion.

---

# TYPOGRAPHY RULES

Typography defines identity.
Never default to system fonts unless intentional.

Use:
- display font
- body font
- mono accent font (optional)

Control:
- letter spacing
- weight contrast
- rhythm

---

# MOTION RULES

Motion must communicate structure.

Use staged reveal:
background
headline
content
controls

Avoid random animation.
Use transform and opacity.

---

# ACCESSIBILITY

Must support:
- keyboard navigation
- focus-visible states
- semantic HTML
- readable contrast

---

# PERFORMANCE

Prefer:
transform
opacity

Avoid:
layout thrash
expensive repaint loops

---

# FAILURE CONDITIONS

Redesign if output feels like:
- generic SaaS UI
- template UI
- default Tailwind UI
- default shadcn UI

---

This skill produces elite frontend identity systems.
