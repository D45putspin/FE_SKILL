# FRONTEND DESIGN v3.1

This skill produces distinctive, production-ready frontends with:
- aesthetic thesis
- signature differentiator
- token systems
- choreographed motion
- accessibility and performance discipline

## Operating Principle
**Design intent first. Code second.**

## Workflow
1. Fill `templates/design-intent-brief.md`
2. Build foundation with `patterns/foundations.md`
3. Apply token system from `snippets/tokens.css`
4. Compose layouts using `patterns/layout-recipes.md`
5. Add interaction states and motion (`patterns/interaction-states.md`, `patterns/motion-choreography.md`)
6. Validate with `templates/acceptance-checklist.md`

## Quality Guardrails
- Avoid anti-patterns in `anti-patterns/*`
- Ensure keyboard/focus accessibility
- Respect reduced motion
- Prefer product-specific UI over generic templates
